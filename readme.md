# SpaCy for data integration

As part of my university course Informative Systems and Semntic Web I developed this project with the aim to test the potentialities of advanced NLP tools (SpaCy) in the field of data integration, especially for solving issues related to:

- Schema Matching (SM)
- Entity Matching (EM)

The idea is to use either the columns (in SM) or the rows (in EM) for the discovery of similarities between data schema or data tuples.
